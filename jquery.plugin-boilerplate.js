	The semi-colon before the function invocation is a safety net against
	concatenated scripts and/or other plugins which may not be closed properly.

	"undefined" is used because the undefined global variable in ECMAScript 3
	is mutable (ie. it can be changed by someone else). Because we don't pass a
	value to undefined when the anonymyous function is invoked, we ensure that
	undefined is truly undefined. Note, in ECMAScript 5 undefined can no
	longer be modified.

	"window" and "document" are passed as local variables rather than global.
	This (slightly) quickens the resolution process.
